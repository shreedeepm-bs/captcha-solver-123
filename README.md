This is a simple Captcha Solver application. To use it, simply open `index.html` in your browser. The application will display a captcha image, and you can enter the text from the image into the input field. Clicking "Submit" will show you the text you entered. The actual captcha verification logic is not implemented in this example. You can pass a `url` query parameter to load a custom image, e.g., `index.html?url=https://example.com/some-captcha.png`.
